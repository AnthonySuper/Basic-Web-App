# Basic Web App

This is a basic web app.
The git history here will be quite useful, as it will demonstrate the order in which I did things.

## How do I run it?
Make sure yarn is installed, then run `yarn` to update the dependencies.
Then, run `webpack-dev-server` and everything will work!
Hopefully.
